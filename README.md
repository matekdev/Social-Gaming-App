# Social Gaming App - Team Donair

Social Gaming App is a platform created to allow users to easily create games and play them with their friends. Users can create "games" by using our .json scripting language. These "games" can be created to either be multiplayer (ex. RockPaperScissors) or single player if you are feeling a little less social.

Here are a few screenshots of example usages...

A "GameSession" is created by providing the game file name found within `/src/Games`. This game file can be written using our "language" or by using included games we have written ourselves.

With the invitation code provided from using the `/createsession` command; you can now join the game session. A message is broadcasted to all other players within the game session that a user has joined. You can chat to other users within this game session while you wait for the game to start.

Lastly, you can start the game by using the `/startgame` command. This starts the game and now is able to be played by all users within the lobby. The example game below prints out variables stored within our "game" to all users within the game.
